          <h2>What is design thinking?</h2>

          <p>To answer this we have to agree on what design is. I performed a search on Google with the term "What is design" and the resulting findings were not surprising.</p>

          <div class="citation col-xs-12">
            <h2>design</h2>
            <em>noun</em>
            <div>
              <span>none:</span><strong>design</strong>;<span>plural:</span><strong>designs</strong>;
              <ol>
                <li>a plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings ofa  building, garment or other object before it is made.</li>
                <li>a decorative pattern.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <em>verb</em>
            <div>
              <ol>
                <li>decide upon the look and functioning of (a building, garment, or other object), by making a detailed drawing of it.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>While I  agree with the results I don't think they are the best examples. They are output focussed.</p>

          <p>At it's heart, design is the solving of a problem.</p>

          <p>If you're still reading, then you are at least willing to consider that design is a problem solving device, or at least can be.</p>
